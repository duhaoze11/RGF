Hello,

You have done a commendable job in analyzing the issues with the Expertiza web application and proposing specific changes and modifications to improve its functionality. Your understanding of the workflow, knowledge of the system’s models, and your ability to trace and amend the application’s logic are evident throughout your work. 

However, there are a few areas where you could improve upon.

1. While you have described the problems and detailed your intended solutions, you've not provided a comprehensive discussion of your testing methodology. Including specific details about how you tested your changes including the data you used, the scenarios you tested, and whether you performed any negative testing would strengthen your report.

2. It would also be helpful to include screenshots or other visual aids to illustrate the changes you made. This would make it much easier for others to understand what you did and why.

3. Make sure you double-check the format of your text before submission, there are some stray `<code>` tags left in the text which indicate that code is missing or incorrectly formatted.

4. It is beneficial to include some discussions on possible limitations or potential issues of your modifications, or how the system can further be improved in the future.

Keep up the good work and keep striving to improve even further.

Best Regards,
