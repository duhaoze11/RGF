The assignment is generally well-written and it shows that the student understands the problem and the solution. He has explained in detail about the changes made to the 'average_score_for_row' method and he also demonstrated a good understanding of the Ruby on Rails framework. Overall, the student demonstrates a good grasp of programming concepts and an advanced skillset in Ruby on Rails.

Additionally, the testing section was quite thorough and well done. It's a good practice to consider various test scenarios to ensure the program's correctness when changes are made; he demonstrated this well by considering three different scenarios.

However, here are some detailed comments and suggestions for improvement:

1. Links or placeholders ('<link>' or '<image>') used in the text should be replaced with actual GitHub repository links and relevant images/screenshots for better understanding.
2. The assignment structure should be improved. It would be great to divide the text into clear, distinguishable sections like 'Problem Statement', 'Solution Description', and 'Testing'. 
3. Consider numbering the provided scenarios correctly. The numbering is repeating itself in multiple places, so it's not entirely clear which points go with which scenarios.
4. Avoid repetition in text. For example, 'Expertiza Github link' is repeated more than once. 

Consider making these changes for your submission to be completely effective and clear to any reader, and keep up the good work!
